# Google Newslab Fellowship - Jiggle

> Just make your own animating chart in a minute. 

In Korea, many people consume news through portal sites almost about 77% contrast to 4% only from media hompage. It means journalist in Korea heavily depends on the publishing process and restrictions to portal sites. 

We focused on this problem and also give journalist more chances to be handling their own materials in article especially **chart**.
